# CSS-Animation
 This project is an experiment with CSS images and animations. Mostly inspired by the Zero to Mastery HacktoberFest 2019 challenge, Animation Nation. I will keep adding and updating this project as I learn new techniques and tricks to make better animations. No use of JS / SVG, purely CSS powered!
